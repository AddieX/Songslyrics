            Tell 'em to shoot
            I'm out the loop, I'm outta range
            Oh-yeah, I stay out the way-ay-ay!
            Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
            But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence
            If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
            In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet
            Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
            Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody knows shit
            I need you to get the fuck out of my space (yeah)
            Replacement's on the way, please don't play
            That pussy's feelin' like a great escape (oh, oh)
            Don't need no trick, old dogs don't change
            I'm fuckin', I ain't makin' love no more (pussy)
            You got a new bitch, what the fuck you cryin' for?
            I'm movin' selfish, callin' all my favorite hoes
            You know how to reach me every time and it plays in your mind
            With a rush that feels like, we committin' a crime
            You know where you belong, I'm gon' save you a spot
            But we can't be outside 'cause the block is too hot
            And I'm all on your mind
            Wherever you are, don't call me! (Let's go)
            Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin' (alright)
            But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence (yeah, yeah)
            If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent (okay)
            In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet
            Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
            Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody knows shit (let's–)
            Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
            Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit (yeah-yeah)
            I need total confidential private shit (yeah)
            Don't want no one thinkin' I'm a groupie (it's lit)
            Time zones change, now we on a first-class trip (straight up)
            Don't work my nerves, you know I get moody
            We fuckin', we ain't makin' love no more
            You talk that talk, but it don't match it with some stroke
            Wherever you are
            Whatever you need
            Don't call me
            Don't call me!
            Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
            But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence (alright)
            If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
